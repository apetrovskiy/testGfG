Maximum value in a bitonic array 
Easy Accuracy: 56.62% Submissions: 8878 Points: 2
Given an array Arr of N elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the maximum value.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 9
Arr[] = {1,15,25,45,42,21,17,12,11}
Output: 45
Explanation: Maximum element is 45.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5
Arr[] = {1, 45, 47, 50, 5}
Output: 50
Explanation: Maximum element is 50.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaximum() which takes the array arr[], and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 106
