Huffman Encoding
Medium Accuracy: 38.67% Submissions: 11527 Points: 4
Given An array of Alphabets and their frequency. Your task is to print all the given alphabets Huffman Encoding.
Note: If two elements have same frequency, then the element which if at first will be taken on left of Binary Tree and other one to right.

Input:
First line consists of test cases T. First line of every test case consists of string of alphabets and second line consists of its frequencies.

Output:
Print the HuffmanCodes in single line, with n spaces of each alphabet's HuffmanCodes respectively. In PreOrder form of Binary Tree.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=|String length|<=26

Example:
Input:
1
abcdef
5 9 12 13 16 45
Output:
0 100 101 1100 1101 111

Explanation:
For the above test case.
HuffmanCodes will be
f: 0
c: 100
d: 101
a: 1100
b: 1101
e: 111
Print in the PreOrder of Binary Tree.
